Your open-source robotic mobile manipulation stack

## Core Concepts

This package assumes you have a low-cost mobile robot with limited compute -- initially a [Hello Robot Stretch](hello-robot.com/) -- and a "workstation" with more GPU compute. Both are assumed to be running on the same network.

In general this is the recommended workflow for hardware robots:
  - Turn on your robot; for the Stretch, run `stretch_robot_home.py` to get it ready to use.
  - From your workstation, SSH into the robot and start a [ROS launch file](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) which brings up necessary low-level control and hardware drivers.
  - If desired, run [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) on the workstation to see what the robot is seeing.
  - Start running your AI code on the workstation!

We provide a couple connections for useful perception libraries like [Detic](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic) and [Contact Graspnet](https://github.com/NVlabs/contact_graspnet), which you can then use as a part of your methods.

## Installation & Usage

This project contains numerous packages. See individual package docs for corresponding details & instructions.

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [home_robot](src/home_robot) | Core package |
| [home_robot_hw](src/home_robot_hw) | ROS package containing hardware drivers for the Hello Stretch Robot |
| [home_robot_sim](src/home_robot_sim) | Simulation |
| [home_robot_client](src/home_robot_client) | Minimal remote client |

Entry points:
- To set up the hardware stack with a Hello Stretch Robot, see instructions in `home_robot_hw`.
- To set up the simulation stack with Habitat, see instructions in `home_robot_sim`.
- For the OVMM challenge, see [here](projects/stretch_ovmm/README.md).


## Code Contribution

We use linters for enforcing good code style. The `lint` test will not pass if your code does not conform.

Install the git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks by running
```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
cd $HOME_ROBOT_ROOT
pre-commit install
```

To format manually, run: `pre-commit run --show-diff-on-failure --all-files`
